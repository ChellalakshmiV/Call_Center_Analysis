# Call Center Analysis

### Project Overview:
The aim of the call center analysis project in Power BI is to evaluate key performance metrics, including total calls, answered calls, rejected calls, issue resolution rates, and customer satisfaction scores. By examining these metrics by topic, the project seeks to identify areas for improvement and enhance operational efficiency.Utilizing Power BI's powerful visualization capabilities, this project intends to deliver actionable insights to optimize staffing levels, refine training programs, and improve customer service processes, ultimately enhancing overall performance and customer experience.

### Data Sources:
This dataset, provided by PwC Switzerland's Virtual Internship Program through Forage, contains call records from a customer service center. Each row represents an individual call and includes attributes such as Call ID, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, whether the call was Answered (Yes/No), Resolved status, Speed of Answer in seconds, and Average Talk Duration.

### Project Tools:
- Power BI Desktop
- Microsoft Excel
- DAX language


### Insights
**Call Distribution:**
- Out of a total of 5,000 calls, 946 were rejected and 4,054 were answered.
- Among the answered calls, 3,646 were resolved while 1,354 remained unresolved.
- Overall, Monday had the highest number of calls, followed by Saturday.

**Topic Distribution:**
- Streaming issues are the most frequent topic, followed by Technical Support and payment-related queries.
- In contrast, Admin Support and contract-related issues have comparatively lower call volumes.

**Issue Resolution Rate:**
- Admin Support, Streaming, and Contract-related calls have a high issue resolution rate.
- Conversely, Technical Support and payment-related topics have the highest number of unresolved calls, indicating many issues in these areas remain unresolved.

**Weekend/Weekday Distribution:**
- Overall, weekdays account for 3,516 calls, while weekends have 1,484 calls.
- There are 41% more calls on weekdays compared to weekends.

**Speed of Answer:**
- The average speed of answer varies by topic, with some topics receiving quicker responses than others.
- Streaming, Contract-related calls, and Admin Support calls tend to have faster response times compared to Technical Support and Payment-related calls.

**Agent Performance:**
- The performance of individual agents is analyzed based on metrics such as average talk duration, resolution rate, and speed of answer.
- Jim answered the most calls, totaling 666.
- Dan has the highest resolution rate, followed by Joe and Becky.
- Dan also has the longest average handling time, with 231 seconds, followed by Jim with 228 seconds. 

**Trend Analysis:**
- Identifying peak hours or specific time periods with higher call volumes can aid in optimizing agent scheduling.
- At 13:00, 11:00, and 17:00, call volumes reach their peaks.

### Recommendations:

1. **Identify and Disseminate Best Practices:** Recognize top-performing agents like Dan, Joe, and Becky. Increase their involvement in team training sessions by 5% to share their effective strategies with peers.
For agents with longer average handling times such as Dan and Jim, implement targeted training programs. Allocate an additional 3% of the training budget to enhance efficiency while maintaining high resolution quality.

2. **Resource Allocation Based on Call Trends:** Assign more agents or specialized teams to handle streaming, contract-related, and admin support calls. Increase resource allocation by 5% for these areas to maintain quick resolution times. For technical support and payment-related queries, allocate an additional 7% of resources to improve resolution processes and enhance agent training. This investment should focus on advanced troubleshooting and customer handling skills.

3. **Optimizing Agent Scheduling:** Utilize insights on peak hours (13:00, 11:00, and 17:00) to optimize agent scheduling. Increase staffing levels by 5% during these periods to minimize wait times and improve customer satisfaction. Implement flexible scheduling options and incentivize agents with a 5% bonus for working during peak hours. This approach ensures adequate coverage and meets demand effectively.

4. **Targeted Training and Development:** Develop targeted training and development programs to address identified improvement areas. Increase the training budget by 5% to focus on enhancing agents' technical skills, communication abilities, and problem-solving capabilities. Allocate 3% more resources towards continuous improvement initiatives, such as regular training updates and performance feedback loops, to ensure sustained growth and improvement in resolution rates and customer satisfaction scores.
   
By implementing these practical percentage-based strategic changes, the call center can enhance performance, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall efficiency and customer satisfaction in a realistic and sustainable manner.
