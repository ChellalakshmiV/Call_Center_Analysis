# Call Center Analysis

### Project Overview:
The aim of the call center analysis project in Power BI is to evaluate key performance metrics, including total calls, answered calls, rejected calls, issue resolution rates, and customer satisfaction scores. By examining these metrics by topic, the project seeks to identify areas for improvement and enhance operational efficiency.Utilizing Power BI's powerful visualization capabilities, this project intends to deliver actionable insights to optimize staffing levels, refine training programs, and improve customer service processes, ultimately enhancing overall performance and customer experience.

### Data Sources:
This dataset, provided by PwC Switzerland's Virtual Internship Program through Forage, contains call records from a customer service center. Each row represents an individual call and includes attributes such as Call ID, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, whether the call was Answered (Yes/No), Resolved status, Speed of Answer in seconds, and Average Talk Duration.

### Project Tools:
- Power BI Desktop
- Microsoft Excel
- DAX language


### Insights
**Call Distribution:**
- Out of a total of 5,000 calls, 946 were rejected and 4,054 were answered.
- Among the answered calls, 3,646 were resolved while 1,354 remained unresolved.
- Overall, Monday had the highest number of calls, followed by Saturday.

**Topic Distribution:**
- Streaming issues are the most frequent topic, followed by Technical Support and payment-related queries.
- In contrast, Admin Support and contract-related issues have comparatively lower call volumes.

**Issue Resolution Rate:**
- Admin Support, Streaming, and Contract-related calls have a high issue resolution rate.
- Conversely, Technical Support and payment-related topics have the highest number of unresolved calls, indicating many issues in these areas remain unresolved.

**Weekend/Weekday Distribution:**
- Overall, weekdays account for 3,516 calls, while weekends have 1,484 calls.
- There are 41% more calls on weekdays compared to weekends.

**Speed of Answer:**
- The average speed of answer varies by topic, with some topics receiving quicker responses than others.
- Streaming, Contract-related calls, and Admin Support calls tend to have faster response times compared to Technical Support and Payment-related calls.

**Agent Performance:**
- The performance of individual agents is analyzed based on metrics such as average talk duration, resolution rate, and speed of answer.
- Jim answered the most calls, totaling 666.
- Dan has the highest resolution rate, followed by Joe and Becky.
- Dan also has the longest average handling time, with 231 seconds, followed by Jim with 228 seconds. 

**Trend Analysis:**
- Identifying peak hours or specific time periods with higher call volumes can aid in optimizing agent scheduling.
- At 13:00, 11:00, and 17:00, call volumes reach their peaks.

### Recommendations:
1. **Agent Performance Optimization:** Identify top-performing agents such as Dan, Joe, and Becky who exhibit high resolution rates. Recognize their effective strategies and practices and disseminate them across the team. For agents with longer average handling times like Dan and Jim, provide targeted training sessions to enhance efficiency without compromising resolution quality.

2. **Topic-based Resource Allocation:** Allocate resources based on call topic trends. Since streaming, Contract-related, and Admin Support calls show quicker resolution times, consider assigning more agents or specialized teams to handle these topics. For topics like Technical Support and Payment-related queries, focus on improving resolution processes and agent training to reduce unresolved cases.

3. **Peak Hour Optimization:** Utilize insights on peak hours, such as 13:00, 11:00, and 17:00, to optimize agent scheduling. Ensure that staffing levels are adequately increased during these periods to minimize wait times and improve customer satisfaction. Implement flexible scheduling options or incentivize agents to work during peak hours to meet demand effectively.

4. **Training and Development Programs:** Develop targeted training and development programs to address areas of improvement identified in the analysis. Focus on enhancing agents' technical skills, communication abilities, and problem-solving capabilities to improve resolution rates and customer satisfaction scores across all topics.
